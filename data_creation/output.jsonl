In the first step, the leaving group (E) leaves and forms a carbocation intermediate. In the second step, a nucleophile attacks at the empty carbon atom to form the product. The orientation of this attack determines whether the stereochemistry remains unchanged or changes during the reaction. This phenomenon is known as stereochemical control, where the directionality depends on the location of the electrophile relative to the leaving group and the nucleophile.

The sorting process involves multiple steps, including endocytosis and fusion with the lysosome. Mannose-6-phosphate (MNP) is an endocytic receptor present on the surface of the endosomal membrane that binds to MNP-containing proteins such as lysosomal enzymes. The binding of MNP to these proteins triggers the fusion of the endosomes with the lysosomes, allowing the lysosomal enzymes to be released into the lysosomes for degradation. This process allows for the efficient targeting of lysosomal enzymes to their specific cellular location, ensuring their proper function in the cell.", "Fine-Tuned Score": 5, "Fine-Tuned Reasoning": "Student Answer 2 clearly outlines the process by which mannose-6-phosphate (MNP) facilitates the targeting of lysosomal enzymes.

{"File Name": "Physics.pdf", "Page Number": 39, "Question": "Why does water stay in a bucket when it is at the top of a vertical circular motion?", "Reference Answer": "Water stays in the bucket due to the net force being directed downward, which is a result of the water's velocity being perpendicular to the net force.", "Base Answer": "Water rises up to the edge. When you are standing on a boat, if its sides were vertical then all your weight would be balanced by the upward pressure exerted by the bottom of the boat and so there would not be any force pushing you upwards or downwards. But as we know that gravity pulls us down with $g$ , this means our body has to counter this downward pull using an equal but opposite reaction (upwards) which causes one end of the boat to rise vertically while other sinks down due to Archimedes principle .

Other groups may interact non-covalently (through van der Waals interactions) leading to changes in overall molecular structure allowing reactions between two molecules even if they are not normally compatible based on their natural structures alone.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates how this works: Enzymes help lower activation energies because they allow more stable intermediates into products faster than normal - meaning less", "Fine-Tuned Score": 4, "Fine-Tuned Reasoning": "Student Answer 2 offers a comprehensive explanation of how enzymes lower activation energy through various mechanisms.

This process proceeds via the formation of an alkene intermediate with two protons at each carbon, where the more stable form (cis) is favored by thermodynamic considerations and hence is produced as the major product.\n\nLindlar’s catalyst is used in the synthesis of cis-alkenes because it forms trans-alkynes instead of cis-alkenes when reacted with alkenes.", "Base Score": 3, "Base Reasoning": "Student Answer 1 demonstrates a good understanding of the role of Lindlar's catalyst in producing cis alkenes.

This reaction will proceed via Markovnikov addition, which states that the positive hydrogen atom attaches to the carbon bearing more substituents and the negative halogen atom attaches to the less substituted carbon. However, when using only one equivalent of HX, this cannot occur because there are two possible products; either the hydrogen atom adds to the carbon containing the most substituents or it adds to the carbon with fewer substituents.
